## Submitting Pull Requests

Pull requests welcome! If you have an idea for a more complicated change, it's typically best to create an issue to discuss your idea, or comment on an existing issue if one already exists for the change. You can then [fork the repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests).

### Smaller is Better

Submit **one** pull request per bug fix or feature. A pull request should contain isolated changes pertaining to a single bug fix or feature implementation. Please **do not** refactor or reformat code that is unrelated to your change, that should be in a separate PR. It's better to **submit many small pull requests** instead of a single large one. Large pull requests will take a long time to review, or may be rejected altogether.

### Coordinate Larger Changes

For large and non-trivial changes, open an issue to discuss a strategy with the maintainers. Otherwise, you risk doing a lot of work for nothing!

## Follow Formatting and Linting Conventions

Keep your code consistent with the formatting and linting conventions in the rest of the codebase. This project uses Prettier, and I recommend you install the VS Code extension. This way you can format the code on save, which avoids you having to run `npm run format` later on.

### Write Tests

Testing is actually fun, I swear! Add unit or integration tests whenever possible. Follow existing patterns for implementing tests, this repo uses [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) and [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/). Vitest is extremely similar to Jest, so if you know that you can pick it up quickly!

### Document/Comment When Necessary

Have a strange regex? A workaround for a library bug? Add a comment explaining why those changes were added. For the most part, your code should be self-documenting by using types and detailed variable and function names.

### Use the Repo's `main` Branch

Branch from and [submit your pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to the repo's default branch.

### Address Any CI Failures

If your pull request fails to build or pass tests, please push another commit to fix it. See the [README](../README.md) for building, formatting/linting, and testing info.
